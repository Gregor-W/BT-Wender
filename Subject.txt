prepare and images for machine learning (2D/3D algorithms)

- working with Generative Grasping Convolutional Neural Network (gg-cnn)
- running gg-cnn on AWS Machine, later using GPU
- input/output (interface) for gg-cnn
- first training gg-cnn with basic, existing datasets
- converting dataset with Festo objects to be compatible
- fit + train the network

focus: make process for new data automated, easy for data scientist, seamless experience
label -> AWS -> train -> store
